#### Background

VP Virginia is concerned about the sales downturn in total widget sales over the past few months, despite being up year over year. She asks data scientist Dave to do a forecast for the rest of 2018 from her Excel spreadsheet.

Dave pulls the data into R and fits a HoltWinters model that can accommodate both trending and seasonality. He then generates a forecast using that model, graphs the results, and publishes the document on RStudio Connect for Virginia so that the document can be shared with others.

## Dave's Forecast

Management has requested a sales forecast for the remainder of 2018 based on historical sales data. This document describes the techniques I used to generate the forecast and summarizes the forecast results.

### Historical Data Used

Management provided the following historical data for the forecast.

### Approach

I fit a Holt Winters model on the total sales from the spreadsheet. I chose the Holt Winters model because it incorporates level, trend, and seasonality components, all of which may be present in our sales data.

Once the model was fit, I created a forecast using that model for the next 9 months and used `ggplot` to show the results graphically. The results of the analysis have been published to our RStudio Connect server where others within the company can view them.

### Results


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

## We do all the computations up front so that we can present the results in report form.

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(tibbletime)
library(forecast)
library(tidyquant)
library(timetk)
library(sweep)
monthly_widget_sales <- read_csv("/tmp/mvd-data/widget_sales_monthly.csv") # Read in the data
monthly_widget_sales_gathered <- monthly_widget_sales %>% 
  select(date, total_sales) %>% 
  gather(product, sales, -date) %>%
  arrange(date) # Gather all the product info into a single column arranged 

## Now gather all the data for each product into its own row, with the sales becoming
## a sub-tibble called 'data.tbl'
monthly_widget_sales_nested <- monthly_widget_sales_gathered %>%
  group_by(product) %>%
  nest(.key = "data.tbl")

## We need a time series for forecasting, so make one for each product

monthly_widget_sales_ts <- monthly_widget_sales_nested %>%
  mutate(data.ts = map(.x = data.tbl,
                       .f = tk_ts,        # this function creates the time series
                       start= 2016,
                       freq = 12))

monthly_sales_models <- monthly_widget_sales_ts %>%
  mutate(fit.model = map(data.ts, HoltWinters))     # apply HoltWinters model and put output in data.ts

monthly_sales_forecasts <- monthly_sales_models %>%
  mutate(fcast = map(fit.model, forecast, h=9)) # apply forecast for 6 months

## Final steps: unnest the forecasts for each product into tidy form and then plot results
monthly_sales_forecasts_tidy <- monthly_sales_forecasts %>%
  mutate(sweep = map(fcast, sw_sweep, fitted = FALSE, timetk_idx = TRUE)) %>%
  unnest(sweep)

```


Here is the sales data through June.

```{r results="asis", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::kable(tail(monthly_widget_sales_gathered, 6) %>%  select(date, sales), 
             caption = "Historical Widget Sales 2018",
             digits=0, format.args=list(big.mark = ','), format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:30%;'")
```

---

Our forecast yields the following results through Q1 of 2019.
```{r results="asis", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::kable(as.data.frame(monthly_sales_forecasts$fcast) %>% select(Point.Forecast), 
             caption = "Widget Sales Forecast",
             digits=0, format.args=list(big.mark = ','), format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:30%;'")
```

---

If we combine the historical data with the forecast, we can show the results graphically as follows. The forecast values appear in red.

```{r monthly data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
monthly_sales_forecasts_tidy %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = index, y = sales, color = key, group = product)) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lo.95, ymax = hi.95), 
                fill = "#D5DBFF", color = NA, size = 0) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lo.80, ymax = hi.80, fill = key), 
                fill = "#596DD5", color = NA, size = 0, alpha = 0.8) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(title = "Holt Winters Model Forecast",
         subtitle = "Total Sales of Widgets",
         x = "", y = "Thousands") +
    scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year", date_labels = "%Y") +
    scale_color_tq() +
    scale_fill_tq() +
    facet_wrap(~ product, scales = "free_y", ncol = 2) +
    theme_tq() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### Conclusions
Based on the historical data provided, we expect declining sales through the end of the year, with a possible recovery in the first quarter of 2019.
